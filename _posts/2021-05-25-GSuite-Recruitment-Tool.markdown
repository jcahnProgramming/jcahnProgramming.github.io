description: This suite of tools created with Google Forms and Google Sheets allows the owners to customize the form to their liking for recruitment for companies/organizations/teams etc. Once you customize the form, the Google Sheet will automatically take responses based on specific criteria (currently set up for "job type") and sorts them into their own sheets based on which job the user applies for. Administrators who have access to the internal Google Sheet can then sort applications based on other questions, they can also comment on the status of the application right inside the spreadsheet (for administration only).
